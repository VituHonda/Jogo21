# Description
Game done with the Java classes developed during the course of OOP in Java on my second year of Informational Systems in FIAP. With some research and tries learning Java SWING, a toolkit made for GUI development, i was able to create the interface for this app.

# The App

This is the starting screen.

When you start playing you have the option to show your cards and end the game or buy more cards until you get satisfied with your ponctuation.

When you click on the button "Mostrar cartas" you end the game, the cpu cards are generated and shown, after a pop-up shows up informing if you win or lose.

Win Message

To keep playing you need to restart the game. In order to do that you need to click on the menu option and then restart. That will put you back to the starting screen.

# Conclusion

It was a really cool project, it was nice do discover that it is possible to develop GUIs to Java applications. Besides that, it was possible to practice some of the stuff i know about the language and it was nice to learn new stuff out of the University content.
